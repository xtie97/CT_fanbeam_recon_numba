# CT_fanbeam_recon_numba :computer:

Leveraging **numba** to accelerate the computational processes of CT imaging, this repository offers parallel computation methodologies for both CT forward projection and filtered backprojection in a fan-beam geometry, specifically tailored for curved detectors.

## :zap: Highlights

- **Acceleration Technique**: [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
- **Geometry**: Fan-beam with a special focus on curved detector setups.

## :gear: Features

- **Parallel Computation**: Achieve faster computational times by parallelizing the forward projection and backprojection processes.
- **Filtered Backprojection**: Works for fan-beam geometry.
